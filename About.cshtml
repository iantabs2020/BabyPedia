        As the Coronavirus disease pandemic is still ongoing, the importance of technology arises. Online work is becoming the standard norm due to the New Normal crisis of staying at home, doing our best not to spread the virus any further.

        With that said, face-to-face appointments must be limited as a safety precaution for those who wish to meet doctors and health workers in health centers and hospitals. These apply to parents/guardians especially the ones tending to their infants or babies that need all sorts of mandatory vaccinations.

        While it is obvious that vaccinations will be held in clinics, health centers, and hospitals, to minimize COVID-19 infection and spread, an online platform sounds ideal in making appointments, regular check-ups, e-prescription, monitoring of symptoms after vaccination, online payments for health services and check-ups, and information about each vaccination needed by infants/toddlers, and lastly, viewing of patient information.
